by the Fifteenth Karmapa, Khakhyab Dorje

om ah hung benza guru pema siddhi hung
Oṃ āḥ hūṃ vajra guru padma siddhi hūṃ

Supreme protector of sentient beings, Orgyen Rinpoche,
rigdzin khandrö tsok dang chepa la
Together with the assembly of vidyādharas and ḍākinīs—
dak sok tsé chik güpé solwa deb
To you we pray with one-pointed devotion!
shyalshyé shyindu ying né tser gong la
As you promised, consider us lovingly from the absolute expanse!
nyam tak dro la tukjé zik su sol
Look upon us, exhausted beings, with compassion!
solwa deb so orgyen rinpoche
We pray to you, Orgyen Rinpoche:
kyen ngen dok chik ma dang khandrö tsok
Dispel adversity and pacify all discord
mitün dü kyi güpa kün shyi shying
From mātṛkās and ḍākinīs and degenerations of the age;
chinang nöchü jorpa rabtu gyé
Increase prosperity in the environment and among its inhabitants;
dü truk né rim sayö busin sok
Conflict, epidemics, earthquakes, plagues of vermin and so forth,
zukchen zukmé samjor ngenpé pal
Evil thoughts and actions among those with and without form—
mitün chok kün shyiwar dzé du sol
Please pacify all such forms of adversity!
tenpa dar shying tendzin kutsé ten
May the teachings spread and the holders have long lives,
jikten dekyi pal gyi gangwar shok
And may the splendour of joy and happiness fill the world!

Thus, the glorious Karmapa composed the Aspiration for the Country’s Welfare. May it be virtuous!
